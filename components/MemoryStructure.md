Since it is indeed not obvious for newcomers that memory structure might be described in "Inference Control",
here is a link to it in the wiki page "Memory Structure" for now:
https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Inference-Control (see Memory structure and control strategy)

(the Wiki will be updated also taking the the parts mentioned in the implementation paper into account soon)
