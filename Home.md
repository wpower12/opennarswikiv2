# OpenNARS
OpenNARS is the open source version of the [NARS](https://sites.google.com/site/narswang/home) project, licensed under [GNU GPL v2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html).

This project attempts to uniformly explain and reproduce many cognitive facilities, including reasoning, learning, planning, etc, so as to provide a unified theory, model, and system for AI as a whole. The ultimate goal of this research is to build a thinking machine.

What makes NARS different from conventional computer systems is its ability to learn from its experience and to work with insufficient knowledge and resources.

If you are interested in learning more, the [Overview Tour](tours/Overview.md) provides a high level view of the system and its implementation. Further resources are linked to in the tour, and are also listed below.  For more information on the theory of NAL, take a look at the [References](References.md) page for links to relevant texts.

***
The current stable versions of the system are available for [download](https://drive.google.com/a/temple.edu/folderview?id=0B8Z4Yige07tBUk5LSUtxSGY0eVk&usp=sharing#). Each version contains a JAR file and some working examples. [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html) is needed to run the recent versions. There is a [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/open-nars) of this project.
